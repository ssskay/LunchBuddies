Lunch Buddies Helper For CU Lunch Buddies

If you work at DALI: This coding sample is simple, but demonstrates how I like to use coding to solve problems based on data. 
For context, I am on the Community Team in Christian Union and run the weekly the Lunch Buddies program,
in which we pair different students together for meals so they can get to know each other better.
I surveyed students and got ideas on how to improve the program and created a website based on their feedback.
